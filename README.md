# Car-Resale-Value-Prediction

ABSTRACT:

Due to the huge requirement of used cars and lack of experts who can determine the correct valuation, there is an utmost need of bridging this gap between sellers and buyers. This project focuses on building a system that can accurately predict a resale value of the car based on minimal features like kms driven, year of purchase etc. without manual or human interference and hence it remains unbiased.

The car resale value prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the future resale value of a car based on various factors such as its make and model, age, mileage, and condition. The project will involve collecting and analyzing a large dataset of past car sales and their resale values to train a machine learning algorithm. The resulting model will enable car buyers and sellers to make informed decisions about the value of a car and its potential resale value. This project has practical applications in the automotive industry and can benefit both consumers and businesses involved in car sales and marketing.
